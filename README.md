# qha_fit_EV
A MATLAB script which accepts energies, frequencies, temperature, and pressure as inputs. Will compute the Gibb's free energy for each given temperature and pressure using the Quasi-harmonic approximation and the Grueneisen parameter. An Equation of state fit is performed on the Electronic energies.
